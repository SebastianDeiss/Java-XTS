# An XTS mode implementation for Java #

This repository contains a free implementation of the XTS mode specified in the IEEE P1619(TM)/D16 Standard for Cryptographic Protection of Data on Block-Oriented Storage Devices.  
 
The IEEE standard specifies XTS with AES only, but this implementation allows using XTS with various block ciphers.
